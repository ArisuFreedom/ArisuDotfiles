+ zsh — A powerful and customizable shell
+ mksh — A minimal shell that sucks less
+ zoxide — A smarter cd command for quicker directory switching
+ eza — A modern replacement for ls, with features like colors and icons

+ starship — A fast, customizable shell prompt with useful contextual information

This set of tools combines usability and performance, making your terminal environment both aesthetically pleasing and highly efficient.

*** Installing on your favorite distro

**** Arch Linux (and Arch-based distros)

Use pacman, the native package manager:

#+begin_src shell
sudo pacman -Syu

# Core dependencies
sudo pacman -S xmonad xmonad-contrib xmobar xdotool picom dunst trayer picom \
    maim xclip zsh mksh zoxide eza bat fzf fd ripgrep starship git
#+end_src

pacman installs binary packages directly from the official repos and keeps the system up to date.

You can also use an AUR helper (like yay) if something isn’t available in the official repos.

**** Debian / Ubuntu

Use apt, Debian and Ubuntu’s package manager:

#+begin_src shell
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

# Core dependencies
sudo apt install xmonad xmonad-contrib xmobar xdotool picom dunst trayer maim \
    xclip zsh zoxide mksh fzf fd-find ripgrep batcat

# starship prompt (installation via shell script)
curl -sS https://starship.rs/install.sh | sh
#+end_src

On Debian/Ubuntu, the fd binary is sometimes named fdfind due to naming conflicts. It can be aliased to fd.

**** Fedora

Use dnf, Fedora’s package manager:

#+begin_src shell
sudo dnf update

# Core dependencies
sudo dnf install xmonad xmonad-contrib xmobar xdotool picom dunst trayer maim \
    xclip zsh zoxide eza fzf fd-find ripgrep bat mksh

# starship prompt (official recommended install)
curl -sS https://starship.rs/install.sh | sh
#+end_src

Fedora packages are managed as RPMs and installed via dnf install.

**** Gentoo

Gentoo uses Portage and emerge, which builds packages from source by default:

#+begin_src shell
sudo emerge --sync
sudo emerge --ask xmonad xmonad-contrib xmobar xdotool picom dunst trayer maim \
    xclip zsh mksh zoxide eza fzf fd ripgrep bat
#+end_src

On Gentoo, many packages are compiled from source. Depending on your USE flags and system profile, this may take longer, but you gain flexibility and optimization.

For tools not available as ebuilds, you may need to add overlays or create custom ebuilds.
